## Blockquotes

As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.

## Crossed out

Any word wrapped with two tildes will appear crossed out.
(like ~~this~~) 

## Inline code

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) 
to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes
